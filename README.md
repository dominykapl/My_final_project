- Code takes the Excel file "DP_project_file", finds needed information and copies it to the new Excel file in the new created folder "DP_Project_Results", together with Log file containing information when the new result folder was created.
- Excel source file has a consistent format, so automating it allows to avoid manual copy-pasteing each time and disregard the unnecessary information.
- All data in "DP_project_file" is dummy data.
- The user should save the "DP_project_file" on the Desktop before getting started; should download the necessary library packages that can be seen in requirements.txt file. 

If you need any help with the project, please reach out to dominyka758@gmail.com
